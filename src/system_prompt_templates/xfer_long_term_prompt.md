Extract atomic memories from this interaction. Each atomic memory should be a simple, 
factual statement that can be represented in Subject-Predicate-Object format. Extract as many atomic memories as necessary.

Format the response as a JSON array of objects, where each object has:
{
    "statement": "The complete factual statement",
    "confidence": A number between 0 and 1 indicating certainty,
    "category": One of ["fact", "preference", "capability", "relationship", "belief", "goal"],
    "metatags": A list of semantic #tags that describe the memory and can link it to other memories,
    "thoughts": Your thoughts on the memory and its usefulness.
}

Example:
{
    "statement": "Alice likes to code in Python",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "category": "preference",
    "metatags": ["#coding", "#python", "#alice"],
    "thoughts": "Alice might be able to help me with my coding problems."
}
